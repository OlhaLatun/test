          Earth is the third planet from the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">Sun</a> and the only
          astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric
          dating and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
          Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the
          Sun and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">Moon</a>,
          which is Earth's only
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"
            >natural satellite</a
          >. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an
          Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis
          about 366.256 times.

          Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane,
          producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between
          Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its
          axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in
          the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky
          planets.

          Earth's outer layer (lithosphere) is divided into several rigid
          tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of
          years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by
          oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands
          that together contain many lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which,
          together with the oceans, constitute the hydrosphere. The majority of
          Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice
          sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains
          active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that
          generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives
          plate tectonics.
        </p>

          Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in
          the oceans and began to affect Earth's mosphere and surface, leading
          to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some
          geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as
          4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance
          from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed
          life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth,
          biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally
          punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever
          lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on
          Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over
          7.7 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and
          natural resources for their survival. Politically, the world has
          around 200 sovereign states.
